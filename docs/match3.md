# Ð¡reating Match3 game with PixiJS

In this article, we will create a match3 game using [PIXI](https://pixijs.com/).

Before starting the development, we need to perform 2 steps:

1. Download our [PIXI project template](https://github.com/bolotnikov/pixi-project-template). You can start working on the game right now or check out [the tutorial](pixi_project_template.md) on how to create a PIXI project template.
2. Download [the assets pack](assets/match3.zip) for our game. Assets provided by the great website [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl)

## 1. Creating the tiles board
Let's set the first task to create the board with tiles.

### 1.1. Creating a single field
The first step is to create a board field class and render a single field sprite on the screen.

Create the `game/Field.js` class:
``` javascript

import { App } from "../system/App";

export class Field {
    constructor(row, col) {
        this.row = row;
        this.col = col;

        this.sprite = App.sprite("field");
        this.sprite.x = this.position.x;
        this.sprite.y = this.position.y;
        this.sprite.anchor.set(0.5);
    }

    get position() {
        return {
            x: this.col * this.sprite.width,
            y: this.row * this.sprite.height
        };
    }
}
```

A field is located in a certain column and in a certain row on the board. The `row` and `col` properties of the `Field` class define the row and column.

The `position` getter determines the position of the field on the screen, depending on the position on the board and taking into account the size of the field sprite.

And now we can render a single field on the screen in the `Game` class:

``` javascript
import { Field } from "./Field";
// ...    
export class Game {
    constructor() {
        // ...
        const field = new Field(1, 1);
        this.container.addChild(field.sprite);
    }
}
```

### 1.2. Creating a fields grid
We have a class for the board field and now we can create the board itself, consisting of a number of fields.
Let's create a class `src/scripts/game/Board.js`:


``` javascript
import * as PIXI from "pixi.js";
import { App } from "../system/App";
import { Field } from "./Field";

export class Board {
    constructor() {
        this.container = new PIXI.Container();
        this.fields = [];
        this.rows = App.config.board.rows;
        this.cols = App.config.board.cols;
        this.create();
    }

    create() {
    }
}
```

We will add all elements of the board (fields and tiles) to the board container. And the board container is then added to the scene container.
The board consists of a grid of fields. Let's set all the created fields to the `this.fields` property.
The number of rows and columns should be configurable. Therefore, let's add these settings to the global project config:

```javascript
// ...
export const Config = {
    // ...
    board: {
        rows: 6,
        cols: 6
    }
};
```

To create a board, we need to place its fields on a grid of a given size. That is, create field sprites in each column and each row of the board.
Let's do this in the `create` method:

``` javascript
export class Board {
    // ...
    create() {
        this.createFields();
    }

    createFields() {
        for (let row = 0; row < this.rows; row++) {
            for (let col = 0; col < this.cols; col++) {
                this.createField(row, col);
            }
        }
    }
    createField(row, col) {
        const field = new Field(row, col);
        this.fields.push(field);
        this.container.addChild(field.sprite);
    }
}
```
Let's bring the board to the stage in the `Game` class:
``` javascript
// ...
export class Game {
    constructor() {
        // ...
        this.board = new Board();
        this.container.addChild(this.board.container);
    }
// ...
}
```

Now the board is located in the upper left corner. Let's fix this by aligning its position to the center of the screen.
We can get the size of the board's field by taking the first element from the generated fields array and reading the width of its sprite:
`this.fields[0].sprite.width;`
Knowing the size of one field, we can calculate the size of the entire board by multiplying the number of rows and columns by the size of the field:

``` javascript
        this.width = this.cols * this.fieldSize;
        this.height = this.rows * this.fieldSize;
```
Knowing the size of the board and the size of the screen, we can make the right padding for the board container.
Subtract the size of the board from the size of the screen and the resulting remaining space will take up 2 indents to the left and right of the board:
``` javascript
export class Board {
    constructor() {
        // ...
        this.ajustPosition();
    }
    // ...
    ajustPosition() {
        this.fieldSize = this.fields[0].sprite.width;
        this.width = this.cols * this.fieldSize;
        this.height = this.rows * this.fieldSize;
        this.container.x = (window.innerWidth - this.width) / 2 + this.fieldSize / 2;
        this.container.y = (window.innerHeight - this.height) / 2 + this.fieldSize / 2;
    }
}
```
