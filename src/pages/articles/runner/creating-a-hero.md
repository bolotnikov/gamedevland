Let's place the hero sprite on the platform we just created.

Let's create the `Hero.js` class:

``` javascript
import * as PIXI from "pixi.js";
import { App } from '../system/App';

export class Hero {
    constructor() {
        this.createSprite();
    }

    createSprite() {
    }
}
```

Implement the `createSprite` method:

``` javascript
    createSprite() {
        this.sprite = new PIXI.AnimatedSprite([
            App.res("walk1"),
            App.res("walk2")
        ]);

        this.sprite.x = App.config.hero.position.x;
        this.sprite.y = App.config.hero.position.y;
        this.sprite.loop = true;
        this.sprite.animationSpeed = 0.1;
        this.sprite.play();
    }
```

The hero consists of two images: `walk1` and `walk2`.
From these two images, we can create a frame-by-frame animation of walking.
For this we use the `PIXI.AnimatedSprite` class. In the constructor of this class, we pass an array of textures from which we want to create an animation. And the `App.res` method just returns the texture by key.

Let's place the sprite in the initial position, which we will set in the global game config `Config.js`:

``` javascript
// ...
export const Config = {
    // ...
    hero: {
        position: {
            x: 350,
            y: 595
        }
    },
    // ...
};
```

Set the `loop` flag to `true` to loop the animation and set the desired playback speed:

``` javascript
        this.sprite.loop = true;
        this.sprite.animationSpeed = 0.1;
```

And  call the `play` method to start animation.

``` javascript
        this.sprite.play();
```


Now we have a hero class and we can create a hero object on the stage in `GameScene.js`:

``` javascript
export class GameScene extends Scene {
    create() {
        // ...
        this.createHero();
    }

    createHero() {
        this.hero = new Hero();
        this.container.addChild(this.hero.sprite);
    }
}
```
