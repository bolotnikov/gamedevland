Before we start the movement of the platforms, we need to activate physics in the projects.
To do this, first let's install the npm package with the `MatterJS` physical library:

``` bash
npm i matter-js
```

Let's activate the engine in `App.js`. To do this, follow 3 steps:
  - engine initialization
  - creating a runner
  - running the engine

``` javascript
import * as Matter from 'matter-js';
// ...
class Application {
    run(config) {
        // ...
        this.createPhysics();
    }

    createPhysics() {
        this.physics = Matter.Engine.create();
        const runner = Matter.Runner.create();
        Matter.Runner.run(runner, this.physics);
    }
    // ...

}
```
